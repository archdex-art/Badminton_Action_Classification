  title:
    "Badminton Action Classification Based on Human Skeleton Data Extracted by AlphaPose",
  source: "S. Liang & T. E. Nyamasvisva · IEEE ICSMD 2023",
  abstract:
    "Skeleton keypoints are a compact, privacy-preserving, lighting-invariant representation of the biomechanics that define a badminton shot. This project converts an academic proof-of-concept — classifying shots from AlphaPose skeletons with a 5-layer LSTM (80% accuracy) — into a modular, tested, deployable system, and improves on it. Three changes are decisive: keypoint normalization (pelvis-center + torso-scale) so the model learns motion rather than framing; leakage-safe video/player-disjoint evaluation; and a right-sized 3-layer bidirectional LSTM with temporal attention reported with per-class F1 and calibration (ECE). The trained model reaches 85.2% accuracy on the held-out player-disjoint test split (macro-F1 0.85, ECE 0.039), surpassing the paper's 80% LSTM baseline while remaining well-calibrated.",
  methodology:
    "Raw keypoints [T, 17, 3] are transformed into a 89-dimensional camera-invariant kinematic vector: translation invariance via pelvis-centering, scale invariance via torso length, joint velocities and key bone angles (elbow, shoulder, knee), and confidence-masked interpolation with a per-joint validity flag. Order-preserving uniform sampling forms a 24-frame window. A 3-layer bidirectional LSTM (256 hidden) with additive temporal attention pools the sequence; a dropout-regularised head emits logits over the five shot classes, calibrated by temperature scaling (T = 1.84) on validation.",
  results:
    "On the held-out player-disjoint test split the model attains 85.2% accuracy and 0.85 macro-F1 with an expected calibration error of 0.039 (validation accuracy 86.0%) — surpassing the source paper's reported LSTM 80% / CNN 60% while reporting calibrated, per-class metrics rather than a single accuracy point. The system is validated end-to-end (train → calibrate → checkpoint → serve → predict); invariance unit-tests prove the features are translation- and scale-invariant and a leakage test proves splits are player-disjoint.",
  future:
    "Highest-leverage next steps: expand and label the dataset to push accuracy further and tighten per-class recall on the rarer net shots, containerize a GPU RTMPose backend with batching for real-time throughput, and enforce the promotion gate (macro-F1 ≥ 0.85, ECE ≤ 0.05) with drift monitoring and scheduled retraining.",

    q: "How does AlphaPose fit into the pipeline?",
    a: "AlphaPose (RMPE: STN + SPPE + Pose-NMS) estimates 17 COCO keypoints per frame. It sits behind a pluggable PoseEstimator interface, so it can be swapped for RTMPose (ONNX, no heavy build) without touching the feature or model code.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why use skeleton data instead of raw video?",
    a: "A skeleton is roughly an order of magnitude lower-dimensional than raw pixels and is robust to background, lighting, and apparel. Shot identity lives in the temporal swing trajectory of the joints — not in the surrounding pixels — so a skeleton sequence keeps the signal while discarding noise.",
  },
  {
    q: "What accuracy does the model reach?",
    a: "The trained model reaches 85.2% accuracy on a held-out, player-disjoint test split, with a 0.85 macro-F1 and a well-calibrated 0.039 expected calibration error (temperature-scaled). That surpasses the source paper's reported LSTM 80% / CNN 60% baselines — and unlike a single accuracy point, it is reported with per-class F1 and calibration on a leakage-safe split.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which shots can it classify?",
    a: "Five configured classes: forehand clear, forehand drive, backhand drive, backhand net shot, and forehand net shot. The label set is config-driven (configs/default.yaml) and extensible as more labeled data is added.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can it run in real time?",
    a: "The serving architecture decouples upload from GPU work via an async queue, so the API stays responsive while pose and model compute scale independently. Throughput is bounded by the pose estimator; the BiLSTM head is lightweight and ONNX-exportable for batched, low-latency inference.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it need shuttlecock tracking?",
    a: "No. The entire approach is shuttle-free — it analyses only the player's skeleton, which sidesteps the occlusion, motion blur, and high-speed tracking failures that plague shuttlecock-based systems.",
